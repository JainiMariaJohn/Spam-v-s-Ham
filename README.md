This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam).

Key Features
SVM Classifier: Utilizes the SVM algorithm to build a predictive model based on the characteristics and content of SMS messages.
Data Preprocessing: Provides methods and instructions for cleaning and formatting SMS data to prepare it for training and testing.
Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes standard evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the performance of the classifier.
Ease of Use: Offers straightforward scripts and instructions for users to train the classifier and make predictions on new SMS messages.
